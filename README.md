# Image Resizer

This Python script resizes an image using the OpenCV library. It loads an image, resizes it based on a specified scale percentage, and saves the resized image to a new file.

## Usage:

```bash
python Image_Resizer.py
```

### Instructions:

1. Open the script in a text editor.
2. Edit the `source` variable to specify the path of the input image (e.g., "saiyam.jpg").
3. Edit the `destination` variable to set the name of the output image (e.g., "new_saiyam.png").
4. Edit the `scale_percent` variable to set the desired percentage of resizing.
5. Run the script.

The resized image will be saved with the specified name in the same directory.

## Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
